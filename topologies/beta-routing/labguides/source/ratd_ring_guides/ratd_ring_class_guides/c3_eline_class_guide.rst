   #. Configure a P2P E-LINE service enabling direct Layer 2 adjacency between Customer-3 nodes EOS16 and EOS17.
   
      - This solution should not require any VLAN tagging from the CE devices.
   
   #. Ensure that EOS16 and EOS17 should form an OSPF adjacency with each other and be able to ping each otherâ€™s loopbacks.
